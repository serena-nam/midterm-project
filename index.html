			<p> Microtrends, rapid and short-lived trends, have become increasingly prevalent in today’s fast-paced digital culture. Fueled by social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram, these trends can gain and lose popularity within a matter of weeks. Although microtrends can allow individuals to find their style, microtrends often lead to a marginalization of ideas and creativity, where individuals feel pressured to follow the latest trend to fit in, resulting in a loss of personal style and individuality. As people chase the next big thing, overconsumption becomes a byproduct, with consumers frequently buying new items to stay relevant. This cycle not only fosters wastefulness but also undermines the value of self-expression by making individual tastes secondary to fleeting trends.

			<p> Microtrends contribute significantly to the rise of conformer culture, where individuals feel compelled to follow the latest trends in order to fit into societal norms. With trends constantly shifting, people often adopt the most popular styles, aesthetics, or behaviors without fully considering whether these align with their true preferences or identities. Over time, this erodes individuality, as personal expression becomes overshadowed by the desire to conform to ever-changing standards. Instead of cultivating a unique sense of style or values, many people fall into a cycle of mimicry, prioritizing external validation over personal authenticity. This pursuit of trendiness fosters a homogeneous culture, decreasing value in creative experimentation and self-exploration.

			<p> Microtrends play a critical role in driving overconsumption, as they promote a culture of constant novelty and disposal. The speed at which these trends rise and fall encourages consumers to continuously buy new clothing and accessories in order to keep up with what’s currently "in." This leads to frequent impulse purchases of items that are quickly discarded or deemed obsolete once the next trend emerges. The short lifespan of microtrends fuels a throwaway mindset, where products are treated as disposable rather than lasting. Consequently, this creates excessive waste and contributes to unsustainable consumption patterns, with both environmental and financial costs as people endlessly chase the latest trend.
